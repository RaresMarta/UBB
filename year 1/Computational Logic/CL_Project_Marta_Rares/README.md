# Base Conversion and Arithmetic Operations

This repository contains a project developed by **Marta Rares-Petru** as part of coursework for the specialization in Artificial Intelligence, supervised by **Professor Lupea Mihaela**. The project focuses on performing arithmetic operations and conversions between different bases using various methods.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main files:
- `main.py` - Contains the core functions for arithmetic operations and base conversions.
- `utils.py` - Provides utility functions for reading input, conversions, and other helper methods.
- `test.py` - Includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the functions implemented.

## Features

The project offers a menu-driven interface to perform the following operations:
1. Addition of two numbers in a given base.
2. Subtraction of two numbers in a given base.
3. Multiplication of two numbers in a given base.
4. Division of two numbers in a given base.
5. Rapid conversion from base `p = 2^k` (p = {4, 8, 16}) into base 2.
6. Rapid conversion from base 2 into base `q = 2^k` (q = {4, 8, 16}).
7. Conversion using the substitution method.
8. Conversion using the successive divisions/multiplications method.
9. Conversion by using an intermediate base.

### Additional Details

- The user interacts with the program through a simple text-based menu.
- The program handles input validation to ensure the numbers entered are within the specified base and correctly formatted.
- Conversion and arithmetic operations are implemented using integer manipulation, making them efficient and accurate.

## Setup and Usage
